        <p class="conteiner-2">
            Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in Bavaria. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916
            into
            Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922.
            However,
            the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name was founded by Karl Rapp
            (initially
            as Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH). The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to
            Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year. BMW's first product was a straight-six
            aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following the end
            of
            World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and
            railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32 in 1923.

            BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time,
            built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque. The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi
            called
            the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the
            1930s,
            BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.

            Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the
            war,
            BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using as many as 40,000 slave laborers. These consisted
            primarily
            of prisoners from concentration camps, most prominently Dachau. Motorcycles remained as a side-line and
            automobile manufacture ceased altogether.

            BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from
            producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and
            bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with
            the
            BMW 501 luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta
            microcar under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in
            serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz.

            A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a
            separate
            entity. The Quandts' father, Günther Quandt, was a well-known German industrialist. Quandt joined the Nazi
            party
            in 1933 and made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and batteries. Many of his
            enterprises were appropriated from Jewish owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three of
            his
            enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in all. One of his battery factories had
            its
            own on-site concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for laborers was six months. While
            Quandt
            and BMW were not directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi era by his father allowed
            Herbert
            Quandt to buy BMW.

            The relative success of the small BMW 700 assisted in the company's recovery, allowing them to develop the
            New
            Class sedans.

            The 1962 introduction of the BMW New Class compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading
            manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupé and luxury
            sedan models. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series
            compact
            sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupés in 1976 and the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in 1978.

            The BMW M division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the BMW
            M5
            in 1984 and the BMW M3 in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.

            The company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW
            large
            financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.

            In 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand from Vickers Plc.

        The 1995 BMW Z3 expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 BMW X5 was the
        company's entry into the SUV market.

        The first modern mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, (from 1973 to 1975, BMW built
        1672
        units of a turbocharged M10 engine for the BMW 2002 turbo), with most engines switching over to turbocharging
        over
        the 2010s. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 BMW ActiveHybrid 7, and BMW's first mass-production electric car
        was
        the BMW i3 city car, which was released in 2013, (from 1968 to 1972, BMW built two battery-electric BMW 1602
        Elektro
        saloons for the 1972 Olympic Games).After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive
        cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 BMW 2 Series Active Tourer multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).

        In January 2021, BMW announced that its sales in 2020 fell by 8.4% due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
        and
        the restrictions. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, BMW witnessed a rise of 3.2% in its customers'
        demands.

        On 18 January 2022, BMW announced a new limited edition M760Li xDrive simply called "The Final V12," the last
        BMW
        series production vehicle to be fitted with a V-12 engine.

        BMW and Toyota aim to sell jointly-developed hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as soon as 2025.

        On October 5, 2023, it was announced that BMW UK CEO Chris Brownridge will succeed Torsten Müller-Ötvös as the
        CEO
        of Rolls-Royce starting December 1, 2023, as a result of Müller-Ötvös retiring.
