            <p class="tex2">BMW was created in 1917 from the Munich firm Rapp-Motorenwerke. The company was incorporated
                into Knorr-Bremse AG in 1920 before being refounded as BMW AG in 1922. It was the successor of
                Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG, founded in 1916. 1916 is therefore considered BMW's founding year</p>

                X5 in 1999. The unique reception of the X5 made BMW think about developing its X series, and as a
                result, the X3 model was added to the company's product portfolio in 2003.</p>
            <p class="tex5">In 1994, BMW offered British Aerospace for £800 million to acquire Land Rover. Although the
                Rover Group had experienced a 35% increase in sales in the last 8 months, the company was falling. It
                didn't take long that their problem with false sales statistics, small production and average quality of
                products; BMW suffered a loss. The Quandt family, who owned 46% of Rover's shares, began to feel the
                risk of capital loss, with daily financial losses of nearly £1 million reported. The loss didn't last
                long, and BMW's long-term positive presence helped them produce their first ever SUV, the E53 X5. This
                car was exhibited at the Detroit Auto Show in 1999.</p>

                            When it comes to moving an affluent family, there's no better BMW than the X7, the brand's
                            luxurious three-row SUV. While its cargo area and rearmost seats aren't as spacious as
                            rivals such as the Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Mercedes-Benz GLS-class, the Bimmer boasts better
                            driving manners as well as an impressive selection of engines. They range from a 375-hp
                            turbo-six to a 523-hp twin-turbo V-8, with the latter making 630 horses on the
                            highest-class, max-performance Alpina XB7. All models have all-wheel drive and an adaptive
                            air suspension system that promotes a pillow-like ride. The 2023 X7's interior is serene,
                            but it's also packed with upscale materials and modern tech such as the dash's giant curved
                            glass display. Those features, combined with the X7's towing capability and an array of
                            standard active-safety tech, make the biggest BMW one of the best.

                            The X6 is here to finish what it started. The original X6 pioneered a new styling direction
                            for SUVS: the dramatically sloped roof, which cuts down on some cargo space for the sake of
                            coolness. Think of it as an X5 SUV that goes to the gym. Its athletic antics transcend its
                            looks, too. The base engine is a peppy 375 horsepower turbocharged inline-six engine that
                            gives the X6 plenty of scoot. The M60i runs hotter, using a 523-horsepower twin-turbo V-8
                            that's built for pounding pavement at high speeds. Both powertrains are locked to an
                            eight-speed automatic transmission with all-wheel drive. The 617-hp X6 M delivers a far more
                            aggressive experience but is reviewed separately. But don't let its focus on driving
                            entertainment skew what's really at work in the X6. It spoils its passengers with a
                            pleasantly elegant interior complete with an enormous infotainment screen that works a
                            high-tech command center. The X6 has inspired other SUVs, such as the Porsche Cayenne Coupe
                            and Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class Coupe, to lower their rooflines. Which only confirms that it was
                            the X6 that started the move to sleeker SUVs.

                            It may not be as fun to drive as the Porsche Cayenne, nor is it as effortlessly smooth as
                            the Genesis GV80, but the 2024 BMW X5 blends traits from both of those to create an
                            agreeable—and agreeably luxurious—middle ground. From the outset, it's clear the X5 is going
                            for broad appeal. Why else would BMW offer it with a trio of different powertrains,
                            including a silky-smooth inline-six, an authoritative twin-turbo V-8, and an environmentally
                            friendly plug-in hybrid? The SUV's cabin is lined with premium materials and, like other
                            BMWs, includes cleverly integrated technology features like a slick-looking curved digital
                            display that stretches nearly the length of the dashboard. This approach results in a luxury
                            SUV so well-rounded that its few shortcomings are easily overlooked, and the X5 remains one
                            of our favorite mid-size crossovers.

                            One of the best electric SUVs can be found in BMW's showroom right now. The iX is a mid-size
                            SUV similar in size to the brand's well-known X5, but it features two electric motors rather
                            than a single gasoline engine. Entry-level xDrive50 models offer 516 horsepower but, in true
                            BMW fashion, there's a performance oriented M60 trim with 610 ponies. Driven sedately, the
                            iX can motor on for over 300 miles between charges; in our testing both models only
                            delivered 290 miles of highway driving, which is still more than we could muster in the Audi
                            e-tron and the Rivian R1S. Inside, the iX impresses with a cabin design that expertly blends
                            futuristic infotainment tech with high-end materials. The iX's front seats are plush and
                            perfectly comfortable for long-distance driving—and an available hands-free driving mode
                            further facilitates such driving tasks.

                        in 1972, began to improve the BMW E9. The final product was produced from 1968 to 1975 and
                        replaced the highly successful 2002 model. The most popular road version of this car, equipped
                        with a 2.8-liter 168 horsepower engine, became known as the BMW 2800.</p>
                    <p class="tex8">Being in the world of motorsport and car racing is very important for the world's
                        top car manufacturers. This issue was brought to the attention of Italian companies about a
                        century ago. Even world-renowned supercar makers like Ferrari were originally a racing team, and
                        years after they were founded, they built road-going models for the public. Such conditions
                        happened late for the German brands M and AMG; With the difference that they remained affiliated
                        and a subset of the big car manufacturers.</p>

                                    BMW didn't invent the four-door coupe body style, but its 2024 8-series Gran Coupe
                                    is one of the best-looking examples we can think of. Its flowing lines and dramatic
                                    fastback roofline cut an elegant silhouette whether it's cruising or parked. A
                                    silky-smooth turbocharged six-cylinder engine is standard, but a honking twin-turbo
                                    V-8 is available if you want more muscle. Both are quick, dispatching the big sedan
                                    to 60 mph in 4.7 and 3.0 seconds, respectively. The downside of the 8-series'
                                    dramatic exterior styling, though, is a rear seat that's tight for tall
                                    passengers—but that's true of its rivals as well. Speaking of which, the 8-series
                                    runs in a class of excellent sports sedans that includes the Audi S7, the Porsche
                                    Panamera, and the Mercedes-AMG GT four-door, all of which offer similar performance
                                    and panache.

                                    so with slightly less cargo space and slightly more style. Propulsion is generated
                                    by a twin-turbo V-8 fitted with a hybrid system, which churns out 617 horsepower and

                                    aggressive handling, and BMW claims that it's smoothed the edge off of its famously
                                    rocky ride this year. We’ll see. At the very least, we feel certain that the X6 M
                                    still has the chops to remain competitive against the likes of the Audi RS Q8 and
                                    Porsche Cayenne Coupe.

                                    The BMW M4 coupe is a fire-breathing dragon capable of high-flying acrobatics. It's
                                    the two-door analog of the M3 super sedan, similarly pumped up by the automaker's M
                                    performance division for driving thrills. It borrows the M3's ferocious 473-hp
                                    twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine, and we applaud BMW for making a six-speed
                                    manual gearbox and rear-drive standard. The ultra-intense Competition trim bumps
                                    power to 503 horsepower and requires an eight-speed automatic; all-wheel drive is
                                    optional. The M4's firm-riding suspension and sharp steering turn twisty roads into
                                    memorable encounters, but there's also plenty of luxury on board in addition to a
                                    reasonably roomy cabin. We do have our reservations about the M4's stiff ride, wispy
                                    steering feel, and overly complex configurable drive modes, though—important
                                    characteristics that we think are handled with more finesse in competitors like the
                                    Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, Mercedes-AMG C63, and Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio.

                                    Electric powertrains make a lot of sense in a large luxury car. Take the 2024 BMW
                                    i7, which features a powerful EV powertrain with a nearly silent operation that only
                                    serves to enhance the feeling of serenity that luxury buyers expect. Couple that
                                    with a smooth ride and a spacious cabin built from premium materials and you have an
                                    electric 7-series that's worth its asking price. The i7 is a sedan for the
                                    tech-savvy buyer, too, as it's filled to the brim with digital displays and even can
                                    be had with a drop-down theater system for those chauffeured in the back—something
                                    its chief rival, the Mercedes-Benz EQS, doesn't offer. The i7 xDrive60 comes with
                                    536 horsepower and a driving range of up to 318 miles, while a performance-oriented
                                    M70 trim boosts power to 650 hp and offers a range of around 295 miles. A rear-wheel
                                    drive eDrive50 model is offered too, and although BMW hasn't said yet, it should
                                    offer the most driving range of the bunch. Those range numbers are good enough to
                                    compete with rivals such as the Porsche Taycan and the Tesla Model S, neither of
                                    which offer anywhere near the sort of sybaritic luxury that the i7 does.
